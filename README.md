## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional software or dependencies required

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. No build process required - it's a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript project

## How to Play

### Controls

- **Mouse Movement**: Move your mouse up and down to control the left paddle
- **Start Game**: Click the "START GAME" button to begin a new game

### Gameplay

1. **Objective**: Score points by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle
2. **Paddle Control**: Your paddle (left side) follows your mouse cursor vertically
3. **AI Opponent**: The computer controls the right paddle and will try to return the ball
4. **Scoring**: Each time the ball passes a paddle, the opposing player scores a point
5. **Ball Physics**: The ball will accelerate slightly each time it hits a paddle, making the game progressively faster

### Game Mechanics

- **Ball Direction**: The ball's vertical direction changes based on where it hits the paddle
